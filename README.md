# MechaCar_Staistical_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to analyse AutosRus, new prototype "The MechaCar" by performing linear regresion Analysis and running T-test. The results of the tests will determine how the new prototype compares to other vehicles from competing manufacturers.

## Linear Regresion

To perform the linear regresion we utilize the lm() function to help us predict the miles per gallon in the MechaCar
