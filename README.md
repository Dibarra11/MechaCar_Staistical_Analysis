# MechaCar_Staistical_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to analyse AutosRus, new prototype "The MechaCar" by performing linear regresion Analysis and running T-test. The results of the tests will determine how the new prototype compares to other vehicles from competing manufacturers.

## Linear Regresion

To perform the linear regresion we utilize the lm() function to help us predict the miles per gallon in the MechaCar

- The linear regesion model shows a 0.71. significance level, stating little to no variance between the variables.
- The null hypothesisi is rejected since the slope of the model is not equal to zero, the p-value obatained was 5.35 x 10-6 which is smaller than the significance level of 0.05%

## Statistics on Suspension Coils

Utilizing the summarize fucntion, the statistics on suspension coils was obtain by using  the mean, meadian, variance, and standard deviation

## T-Test

T-test was perform to determine the PSI differed from the population mean of 1500 pounds per square inch.

The following code was use to obtain the T-test results
